## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

`config.lua` example:
```lua
Config = {}

Config.Zones = {
    Redzone = {
        center = vector3(-1474.455, -2716.211, 13.944),
        radius = 100.0,
        marker = {type=1, height=2.0, r=200, g=30, b=30, a=120},
        weapon = 'WEAPON_COMBATPISTOL',
        blip = {enabled = true, sprite = 161, color = 1, scale = 1.3, label = "Redzone"}
    }
}

Config.UseBucket = true -- true for FFA isolation
Config.RedzoneBucket = 5001
Config.KillReward = 50
Config.RespawnTime = 5
Config.ChatPrefix = "[Redzone] "
Config.KillstreakAnnounce = {5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50}
Config.RespawnPoints = {
    vector3(-1411.407, -2806.361, 13.944),
    vector3(-1471.11, -2723.32, 13.94)
}
All options are explained in the config file comments.

üí° How It Works
Entering the redzone forces a weapon, gives infinite ammo, and puts the player into a private ‚Äúbucket‚Äù for true FFA.

Players can only see/fight others in the redzone.

Kills are tracked; rewards are only given when the player dies or leaves the zone.

Killstreaks are announced in chat (5, 10, 15, etc).

Upon death, a respawn timer appears and the player is revived at a random zone point.
